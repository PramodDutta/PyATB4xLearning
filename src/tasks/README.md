isosceles (exactly two sides are equal), or scalene (no sides are equal). 
Use an if-else statement to classify the triangle.


### Task #9
✅ FizzBuzz Test:
Write a program that prints numbers from 1 to 100. # Loop For
However, for multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and
for multiples of 5, print "Buzz." 
For numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz."
